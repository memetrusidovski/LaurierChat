# Android Chatbot App with BERT PyTorch Model

This is an Android chatbot app that uses a pre-trained BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model implemented in PyTorch. The app allows users to chat with a conversational agent that uses natural language processing (NLP) to understand and respond to their messages.

## Requirements
To run the app, you need:

- Android Studio 4.2 or higher
- Android SDK 21 or higher
- PyTorch for Android (torch-android) library
- BERT PyTorch model and tokenizer

## Installation
Clone or download the source code of the app from the repository.
Open the project in Android Studio.
Download and extract the pre-trained BERT PyTorch model and tokenizer.
Copy the model and tokenizer files to the app/src/main/assets directory.
Build and run the app on an Android device or emulator.

## Usage
Launch the app on your Android device or emulator.
Type your message in the chat input field and press the send button.
Wait for the chatbot to process your message and generate a response.
Read the response in the chat output field and continue the conversation.

## Features
The app uses a pre-trained BERT PyTorch model to generate responses to user messages.
The model is fine-tuned on a conversational dataset to improve its performance on natural language tasks.
The app uses a tokenizer to preprocess the text input and output of the model.
The app displays the conversation history in the chat output field.
The app supports multiple languages and can be easily extended to support more languages.
